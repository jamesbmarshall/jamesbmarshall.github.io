Hi! I'm James and I am the SMB Customer Lead for Azure at Microsoft in the UK. I work with amazing people on how they can achieve their goals with the AWESOME power of Microsoft Azure.

I started my career in IT in the real world; as an IT Technician in a local secondary school. After becoming a Network Manager I took a career break to go to Reading University in 2008 to study Information Technology.

I've been at Microsoft since 2010 and am proud to have consulted on some of the biggest Office 365 Education deployments in the world, transforming the experience of students and teachers with cutting-edge cloud technology. I have also helped dozens of public sector organisations move away from Windows XP to a modern, secure platform and have even spent some time leading a high-performing technical sales team, co-selling with highly skilled Microsoft Partners. I've been the CTO for Small &amp; Medium-Sized Businesses for the UK, and most recently was a Technology Strategist for some of the world's largest Microsoft distributors, resellers and licensing solution providers.

One of my favourite things to do is <a href="http://jamesbmarshall.com/speaking/">get up in front of an audience</a> and talk about how Microsoft technology can help get people on the path to "Digital Transformation".

You're probably a geek at heart - so am I; with a big passion for using technology in new ways to help people achieve more. In my spare time, I dabble with electronics (my favourite YouTube channel is <a href="http://youtube.com/bigclivedotcom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bigclivedotcom</a>), like to build things with my BBC micro:bit and various Raspberry Pis, eat good food and spend time with my wonderful family.

But enough about me. I want to hear from <strong>YOU</strong>. I love hearing about the cool stuff you're doing with technology, especially Microsoft technology. You can find me online in most forms of social media as <a class="" href="http://twitter.com/jamesbmarshall">jamesbmarshall</a>.

Tweet me and say hello!
