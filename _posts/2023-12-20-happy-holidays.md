This week, I'm enjoying some downtime with my family. It's been six months since I launched this newsletter, and I'm so grateful for all the positivity I've received and to everyone who's subscribed.

Pushing myself to write regularly has been a challenge. I wasn't sure I'd turn a project into a habit - they're hard to form! But here I am, 12 editions later, with plenty of ideas for 2024!

Whether you celebrate Christmas or not, I hope you are having some time to reflect and recharge over the next few days. I'll be back on the 3rd January 2024 with the next Interesting Stuff, but in the meantime, thank you. ❤️
