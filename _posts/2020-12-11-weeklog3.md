It's been wet this week. Wet and cold.

This week:

1. Mysterious pipes are causing the whole building project to be delayed. The rain is causing the whole building project to collapse in on itself. Remind me never to start something like this in winter ever again.

2. Went swimming this week for the first time in months - it felt great to do something vaguely normal again.

3. When you believe in something, you have to stick at it. You will never please everyone, you might encounter resistance. But if it's the right thing to do, it's the right thing to do.

4. Christmas is cancelled, at least as far as going to Wales to be with my family is concerned. Instead, we'll have Christmas at home. It'll be lovely, but it's a shame that yet another plan is affected by COVID-19. When will it all be over?

5. I need to take my diet seriously. Weight loss is going ok, but slowly. Need to look at the make up of what I'm eating - not just how much of it.

6. There's only four more days in work this year - it feels like four weeks. I'm very excited for the time off. Might even finish a book!

Next week: wind up the year, leave as little left to do when I come back from holiday as possible. Start 2021 as I mean to go on.
